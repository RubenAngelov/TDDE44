What do you do?""",

The chest creaks open, and the guard is still sleeping. That's one heavy \
sleeper! You find some diamonds, a shiny sword, and lots of gold coins.
Do you take the treasure or leave it?""",

What do you do now?""",

Those who can count and those who canâ€™t.'
He looks at you with a blank face for a moment, and then swings his axe...""",
